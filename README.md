# Safe_Integer_Class_C++ 

## General idea

Aim to create a helper C++ class to be used in my college programming courses "console" assigments and projects

</br>


## Technique

Make use of this class instead of primitive integer in order to force console user to enter valid integer value or give chance until providing valid integer value , to avoid console crash or solve by throwing exception and close console => more flexible way to test codes with TA's during discussion regardless any bad input :)

</br>

## Motivation
The idea come from my disscusion with my oop course Prof. about is there any ready-made way in c++ to gurantee code safely handle unexpected inputs like execptions and also provides flexiblity for testing and TA's use during disscusion , she suggest to make my own way of handling this and make use of it along course projects.
